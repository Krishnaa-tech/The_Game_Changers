## Mapping of Green Spaces To Reduce Global Warming And Climate Change

## Inspiration ![(image link)
The Mapping of Green Spaces To Reduce Global Warming And Climate Change project draws inspiration from the urgent need to address the challenges posed by global warming and climate change. As the impacts of these issues become increasingly evident, there is a growing recognition of the critical role that urban planning and sustainable development can play in mitigating their effects.

#### This project finds inspiration in the following key factors:

**Environmental Concerns:** The rapid pace of deforestation, urbanization, and pollution has led to the depletion of cities' green spaces, rising temperatures, reduced air quality, and disrupted ecosystems. This project aims to tackle these pressing issues by strategically identifying and enhancing green spaces within urban areas.

**Health and Well-being:** The project is driven by the aspiration to create healthier and more livable urban environments for both human inhabitants and wildlife. Green spaces not only offer cleaner air and cooler temperatures but also serve as recreational spaces that contribute to residents' physical and mental well-being.

**Sustainable Development Goals:** The project strongly aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 13 (Climate Action) and Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). By incorporating cutting-edge technology, data analysis, and urban planning strategies, the project actively contributes to achieving these global objectives.

**Data-Driven Solutions**: The project's inspiration is rooted in the potential of data-driven approaches to provide actionable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and communities. Through the utilization of geospatial data and advanced analytics, the project aims to guide decision-making processes that promote sustainable urban development.

**Collaborative Efforts:** The idea of creating an integrated solution that addresses environmental and societal challenges was sparked by collaboration between data scientists, environmental experts, and urban planners. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the necessity of effective collective efforts to combat climate change.

## What It Does !(image link)
The Mapping of Green Spaces To Reduce Global Warming And Climate Change project encompasses a comprehensive approach to address urban environmental challenges and promote sustainable development. At its core, the project involves leveraging geospatial data, satellite imagery, and advanced data analysis techniques to identify, map, and strategically enhance green spaces within urban areas. The primary aim is to combat global warming, alleviate the impacts of climate change, and foster more resilient cities.

The project unfolds through the following key components:

**Geospatial Data Integration:** The project starts by integrating Geographic Information System (GIS) data, which includes city shapefiles and relevant spatial information. This data serves as the foundation for subsequent analyses.

**Satellite Imagery Utilization:** Satellite imagery is harnessed to provide a comprehensive view of urban landscapes. These images offer crucial insights into vegetation coverage, land use, and spatial patterns, enabling a nuanced understanding of the urban environment.

**Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Calculation: **The project calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using satellite imagery's red and near-infrared bands. This index quantifies vegetation density and health, allowing for the identification of green spaces within urban regions.

**K-Means Clustering for Green Space Identification:** Employing K-Means clustering, the project categorizes NDVI values into clusters representing different levels of vegetation coverage. This segmentation enables the identification of distinct green space zones across the urban landscape.

**Air Quality Analysis:** The project incorporates Air Quality Index (AQI) data analysis with green space mapping. By examining air quality levels in different urban areas, the project identifies regions with lower pollution levels, contributing to healthier living environments.

**Efficient Urban Planning:** The project integrates the outcomes of green space clustering and AQI analysis to pinpoint areas with high vegetation coverage and low pollution levels. These areas are focal points for efficient urban planning initiatives prioritising sustainable development and environmental resilience.

**Visualization and Insights:** The project generates visualizations that portray the identified green space clusters and their relationship with air quality. These visual representations offer valuable insights to urban planners, policymakers, and communities, aiding in informed decision-making.

## How I Built It
The construction of the Mapping of Green Spaces To Reduce Global Warming And Climate Change project involved a systematic approach, combining data analysis, geospatial technology, and advanced machine learning techniques. The development process included the following steps:

Importing Libraries and Data
The project commenced by importing essential data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning libraries. These libraries provided the tools to handle geospatial data and execute advanced computations efficiently.

Data Understanding and Preprocessing
Understanding the data was paramount to the project's success. Geospatial datasets, including city shapefiles and satellite imagery, were carefully examined to grasp their structure, attributes, and spatial relationships. Data preprocessing steps were performed to ensure data quality, consistency, and compatibility.

Creating Correlation and Visualization
One of the initial exploratory tasks involved the creation of a correlation matrix. This matrix illuminated the relationships between various variables within the dataset, aiding in the identification of potential patterns and insights. Visualizations like heatmaps were generated to depict these correlations, enhancing data understanding clearly.

Leveraging Intel one API Toolkit
The Intel one API toolkit was harnessed to optimize the project's performance and accelerate computational tasks. This toolkit, particularly the GeoAnalytics module, provided specialized tools for geospatial data manipulation, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in data processing.

Machine Learning Model Evaluation
Various machine learning models were explored to address the project's clustering needs. The scikit-learn library facilitated the implementation and evaluation of these models. Model performance metrics were used to assess the quality of clustering results and select the most suitable approach.

Integration of AQI Analysis
The project incorporated Air Quality Index (AQI) data analysis, which required understanding air quality metrics, data sources, and analysis methodologies. Intel's oneAPI toolkit was employed to streamline AQI data analysis, ensuring accurate insights into pollution levels.

Efficient Urban Planning Considerations
The integration of green space clusters and AQI analysis results involved complex decision-making. The project's architecture ensured that urban planning decisions aligned with the identified areas of high vegetation coverage and low pollution levels.

Visual Representation
The culmination of the project was the creation of visual representations that effectively communicated the outcomes. Interactive maps, cluster visualizations, and AQI overlays provided clear insights for stakeholders to comprehend the project's impact and recommendations.

The Mapping of Green Spaces To Reduce Global Warming And Climate Change project construction involved a combination of expertise in data science, geospatial technology, and environmental analysis. Through careful consideration of data, technology selection, and advanced analytics, the project aimed to create a valuable tool for informed urban planning decisions and sustainable development.
Positive Impact: At its core, the project's inspiration lies in the belief that it can make a meaningful contribution to the global fight against climate change. By fostering the creation of greener, more resilient cities, the project envisions a future where urban areas are better equipped to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

The inspiration for this project is firmly grounded in the urgency to take action against climate change, the potential for innovative technological solutions, and the shared vision of establishing sustainable urban environments for both current and future generations. The project seeks to combine expertise, innovation, and dedication to create a positive impact on the world's environmental challenges.
