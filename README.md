This project aims to tackle these pressing issues by strategically identifying and enhancing green spaces within urban areas.

**Health and Well-being:** The project is driven by the aspiration to create healthier and more livable urban environments for both human inhabitants and wildlife. Green spaces offer cleaner air and cooler temperatures and serve as recreational spaces that contribute to residents' physical and mental well-being.

**Sustainable Development Goals:** The project strongly aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 13 (Climate Action) and Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). By incorporating cutting-edge technology, data analysis, and urban planning strategies, the project actively contributes to achieving these global objectives.

**Data-Driven Solutions**: The project's inspiration is rooted in the potential of data-driven approaches to provide actionable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and communities. Through the utilization of geospatial data and advanced analytics, the project aims to guide decision-making processes that promote sustainable urban development.

**Collaborative Efforts:** The idea of creating an integrated solution that addresses environmental and societal challenges was sparked by collaboration between data scientists, environmental experts, and urban planners. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the necessity of effective collective efforts to combat climate change.

## What It Does !(image link)
The Mapping of Green Spaces To Reduce Global Warming And Climate Change project encompasses a comprehensive approach to address urban environmental challenges and promote sustainable development. At its core, the project involves leveraging geospatial data, satellite imagery, and advanced data analysis techniques to identify, map, and strategically enhance green spaces within urban areas. The primary aim is to combat global warming, alleviate the impacts of climate change, and foster more resilient cities.

The project unfolds through the following key components:

**Geospatial Data Integration:** The project starts by integrating Geographic Information System (GIS) data, which includes city shapefiles and relevant spatial information. This data serves as the foundation for subsequent analyses.

**Satellite Imagery Utilization:** Satellite imagery is harnessed to provide a comprehensive view of urban landscapes. These images offer crucial insights into vegetation coverage, land use, and spatial patterns, enabling a nuanced understanding of the urban environment.

**Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Calculation: **The project calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using satellite imagery's red and near-infrared bands. This index quantifies vegetation density and health, allowing for the identification of green spaces within urban regions.

**K-Means Clustering for Green Space Identification:** Employing K-Means clustering, the project categorizes NDVI values into clusters representing different levels of vegetation coverage. This segmentation enables the identification of distinct green space zones across the urban landscape.

**Air Quality Analysis:** The project incorporates Air Quality Index (AQI) data analysis with green space mapping. By examining air quality levels in different urban areas, the project identifies regions with lower pollution levels, contributing to healthier living environments.

**Efficient Urban Planning:** The project integrates the outcomes of green space clustering and AQI analysis to pinpoint areas with high vegetation coverage and low pollution levels. These areas are focal points for efficient urban planning initiatives prioritising sustainable development and environmental resilience.

**Visualization and Insights:** The project generates visualizations that portray the identified green space clusters and their relationship with air quality. These visual representations offer valuable insights to urban planners, policymakers, and communities, aiding in informed decision-making.
